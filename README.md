# The-role-of-connectivity-on-COVID-19-preventive-approaches

This repository contains simulation scripts used in the article "The role of connectivity on COVID-19 preventive approaches" (in prep.). 
They allow to simulate the spread of an epidemic in a population where the contact structure is given by a random grap (Erdős-Rényi or Power-Law degree distribution graph).
